# Weekly Dish

A new meal planner app.

## Description

Users can plan their weekly meals across six categories: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for each. They can add dishes day by day or all at once, with the app automatically generating a complete menu with a single click. Each entry can be updated or deleted as needed. 

Additionally, users can request AI-generated recipes for any dish, with allergen warnings included if they have specified dietary restrictions. 

A shopping list can also be created based on the planned menu, making meal prep even more convenient.
